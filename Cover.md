Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Frontend Engineer position at Aicade. The opportunity to work on groundbreaking AI technology that simplifies game creation is both inspiring and aligned with my passion for innovative development. With over 3 years of experience in frontend development, specializing in React, Next.js, and TypeScript, I am eager to contribute to Aicade’s vision of transforming game creation using AI.

I thrive in entrepreneurial environments where I can collaborate with cross-functional teams to bring new ideas to life. I have a solid understanding of state management solutions like Redux Toolkit and am skilled at creating responsive, dynamic user interfaces that deliver seamless user experiences. My startup experience has taught me the importance of flexibility, creativity, and ownership, all of which are essential in building products from the ground up.

Aicade’s focus on using AI to empower users resonates with me, and I am excited by the opportunity to be part of a founding team that is shaping the future of game creation. I am fully open to the equity-based role with the opportunity to transition to a salaried position post-fundraising. I look forward to discussing how my technical skills and entrepreneurial mindset can contribute to Aicade’s success.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to explore how I can make an impact as a part of your team.

Sincerely,
Rajot Das
